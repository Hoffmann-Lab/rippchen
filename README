### ABOUT
RIPPCHEN are tasty!
acquire a taste for peak calling from *IP-Seq experiments or for differential gene expression- and ontology analysis from RNA-Seq data

RIPPCHEN comprises
1) a free implementation of ENCODE best practices for ChIP-Seq analysis
2) gene expression analysis comprising differential analysis, principal component analysis, time course clustering and go enrichment


### REQUIREMENTS
- Internet access
- Linux
- ~10GB disk space for all dependencies and tools going to be installed

### INSTALLATION
1) create a shell variable RIPPCHEN assigned to an installation directory
export RIPPCHEN=/path/to/install/dir
3) store the RIPPCHEN variable permanently to ensure that RIPPCHEN can always find the required tools
echo "export RIPPCHEN=$RIPPCHEN" >> ~/.bashrc
4) download the latest RIPPCHEN release from https://github.com/koriege/rippchen
git clone --recursive https://github.com/koriege/rippchen.git
5) enter the RIPPCHEN directory 
cd rippchen
6) checkout latest stable release
git checkout $(git describe --tags)
7) install RIPPCHEN and all necessary tools (will take a while)
./setup -i all


### UPGRADE
1) follow the INSTALLATION steps 4 to 6
./setup -i upgrade


### DOWNLOAD HG19/GRCh37 or HG38/GRCh38 or MM10/GRCm38 and corresponding files (annotation .gtf, ontology .go, description .info)
1) follow the INSTALLATION steps 4 to 6
./dlgenome -g [hg19|hg38|mm10] -o /path/to/genome/dir


### FIRST RUN INFO
- genomes will be indexed for selected mappers
=> do not run multiple RIPPCHEN instances in parallel unless indexes are created
- in case indexes are already available 
=> copy $RIPPCHEN/bin/rippchen/lib/md5s to <genome.fa>.md5s and insert values returned by the command: md5sum <file>


### RUN
1) following the genome DOWNLOAD instruction will solve the following requirements:
- make sure to have your genome and all related file in the same directory
- all files need to share a common prefix (e.g. hg19.fa and hg19.fa.gtf)
- make sure your genome file ends with .fa and your annotation file ends with .fa.gtf
- make sure your annotation file ends with .fa.gtf and your ontology file ends with .fa.gtf.go
=> 3 tab-separated column file: gene_id GO_id GO_domain
- make sure your annotation file ends with .fa.gtf and your description file ends with '.fa.gtf.info'
=> 3 tab-separated column file: gene_id gene_name gene_description

2) calling for help?
$RIPPCHEN/bin/rippchen/rippchen -h

3) synopsis
$RIPPCHEN/bin/rippchen/rippchen -1 R1.fq -2 R2.fq -g genome.fa


### LOGS and verbosity
- a comprehensive log file 'run.log' file will be created in your output directory, unless defined otherwise
- using the verbose option '-v' will additionally print full log to terminals stdout


### RUN IN BACKGROUND
1) start a screen with a unique name
screen -S myMUVACrun
2) run muvac
3) detach the screen by pressing all 3 keys 'ctrl+a+d'
4) list screens running in background
screen -ls
4) resume a screen 
screen -r myMUVACrun
